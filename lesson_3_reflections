When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with others; or when you need access to the repository from another machine.  I'm looking forward to this as a way to work on these projects from my smartphone!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manual pulls avoid the loss of data from improperly synced files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is a change in code you are experimenting with or changing away from the previous code.  A clone is an exact duplicate of an existing repository.  A fork is similar to a branch, but exists generally as a project entirely separate from your own and run by someone else using your existing code base as a starting point.
