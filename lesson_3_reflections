When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating with others; or when you need access to the repository from another machine.  I'm looking forward to this as a way to work on these projects from my smartphone!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manual pulls avoid the loss of data from improperly synced files, or from malicious tampering.
