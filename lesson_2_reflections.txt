What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An initial empty .git folder is created	to house our commits; it is empty, as we haven't actually made any commits yet!  Without this initialization, git doesn't know where to store our commit history, or what files we'll be relating the repository to.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as a place to ready the files to be added to a commit.  It's akin to the gate area in an airport; only those people who will be boarding are allowed/need to be there, so they can board the plane when needed.
